# sketchCSS
Barebones CSS that you're meant to delete later

A one-file starter CSS kit that's more geared towards planning a layout for your site. 
It has a few utility classes such as "mid", which centers a child element in the exact center of an element using flexbox. 
Or you can use "cols" to instantly create neat-looking and responsive columns out of child elements.
