# sketchCSS

Sketch CSS is a layouting library. You can easily center elements, create columns, and add components like cards, button-like links, and a cookie permission modal.
It's inspired by Bootstrap and Tailwind, but it's ultra lightweight. There's only one stylesheet, and you can configure variables such as the text sizes, margin sizes, and more.

Sketch CSS does not include coloring, shadows, and animations.
